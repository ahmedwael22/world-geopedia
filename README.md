# world-geopedia
World Geopedia by scraping Wikipedia - developed using MySQL DBMS, Flask backend, HTML-CSS-JavaScript frontend

Template for frontend: https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page272/tivo

The database was hosted on www.db4free.net because it was an experimental project and I wanted to minimze/remove costs. To make it more robust, it should be hosted on a more secure database hosting service.

In backend/app.py, I have used a few placeholder strings when connecting with the MySQL server (your-username-here, your-password-here, your-database-name-here)

Scraping Wikipedia was a requirement, and the website is a massive hassle to scrape. Would recommend scraping a different website if you are able to.
