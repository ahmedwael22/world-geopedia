Timezones are now multivalued. They have their own table.



HeadOfState no longer has Date Assumed Office. The primary key is just the name.
Instead, I added the Date Assumed Office to the country.

For example:
Elizabeth II has an entry in HeadOfState table that has just her name, date of birth, and political party.

United Kingdom has an entry in Country table, that has HeadOfState: Elizabeth II, Date Assumed Office: 1952-02-06.

Antigua and Barbuda has an entry in Country table, that has HeadOfState: Elizabeth II, Date Assumed Office: 1981-11-01.
